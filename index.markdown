First off, our group would like to **thank you** for stopping by our booth.  
We're a small hacker space based out of **Nashville, TN**.  
We love learning, teaching, and engineering new and fun things across all demographics — and we wanted to embody that spirit in our design for this challenge coin, and pass that knowledge on to you!

## The Coin's Journey

The challenge coin you see before you is **over a year in the making** — the result of several hundred hours of:

- Research & Development  
- Compiling errors (many, many compiling errors)  
- Prototyping costs  
- Graphic design work  
- Logistical nightmares  
- Enough extracted fumes to fog a small apartment  

*(All accomplished by two people.)*

Each one is **uniquely serialized** and represents what we believe is worth sharing, what's worth ignoring, and — frankly — what looks pretty cool.

## Why We Can’t Sell It to You

Between:

- Materials  
- R&D  
- Tariffs  
- Tax law  
- DefCon laws  
- Other fun legalese  

We **cannot** sell these coins.  
That would be illegal and in clear violation of all the above (in one way or another).

---

## But… This is DefCon

We dirty hackers are pretty good at stretching, bending, and challenging rules.  
We’re under no illusion we’re *above* the law (and for legal reasons, we are stating our group does **not** believe we are above the law) — but we do believe in **freedom, knowledge, and creativity**.  

So, we’re giving away these challenge coins **for free**.

## The QR Code

The QR code on the challenge coin is **the same** as on the stickers.  
They all lead to our **Workshop Resources** — where we’ll keep adding content for budding:

- Electrical Engineers  
- Mechanical Engineers  
- Computer Engineers  
- Anything else we think is worth keeping in one’s back pocket

## Keep the Secret

Share this information.  
Let the cool kids know where you got your shiny new challenge coin…  
…but don’t spoil the secret of **how** to get it.
