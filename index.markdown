# Challenge Accepted

First off, our group would like to **thank you** for stopping by our booth.

We're a small hacker space based out of **Nashville, TN**.

We love learning, teaching, and engineering new and fun things across all demographics — and we wanted to embody that spirit in our design for this challenge coin, and pass that knowledge on to you!

---

## The Coin's Journey

The challenge coin you see before you is **over a year in the making** — the result of several hundred hours of:

- Research & Development
- Compiling errors (many, many compiling errors)
- Prototyping costs
- Graphic design work
- Logistical nightmares
- Enough extracted fumes to fog a small apartment

*(All accomplished by two people.)*

Each one is **uniquely serialized** and represents what we believe is worth sharing, what's worth ignoring, and — frankly — what looks pretty cool.

---

## Why We Can’t Sell It to You

Between:

- Materials
- R&D
- Tariffs
- Tax law
- DefCon laws
- Other fun legalese

We **cannot** sell these coins. That would be illegal and in clear violation of all the above (in one way or another).

---

## But… This is DefCon

We dirty hackers are pretty good at stretching, bending, and challenging rules. We’re under no illusion we’re *above* the law (and for legal reasons, we are stating our group does **not** believe we are above the law) — but we do believe in **freedom, knowledge, and creativity**.

So, we’re giving away these challenge coins **for free**.

---

## The QR Code

The QR code on the challenge coin is **the same** as on the stickers. They all lead to our **Workshop Resources** — where we’ll keep adding content for budding:

- Electrical Engineers
- Mechanical Engineers
- Computer Engineers
- Anything else we think is worth keeping in one’s back pocket

---

## Keep the Secret

Share this information. Let the cool kids know where you got your shiny new challenge coin… but don’t spoil the secret of **how** to get it.

---

## Want to Be Really Cool?

If you’d like to help our hackerspace bring more stuff like this next year — and continue building the backbone of our workshop — you can drop some coin below. *(Only if you want to be really cool, you know.)*

**Payment Options:**

- Cash
- PayPal
- Google Pay
